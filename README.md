# HandAndBrainBot

This is a [Lichess](https://lichess.org) bot which will play with you, but also give you hints of your best move in any position.

HandAndBrainBot will send you a message in the chat giving you a hint when it's your turn to move. HandAndBrainBot will only tell you the name / type of piece (e.g. pawn, rook, knight). It will not tell you where to move it, and which piece to move (if you have more than one of that type on the board).

HandAndBrainBot will also send you some snarky messages if you try to talk to it! (Or prompt inject it).

HandAndBrainBot is powered by [Stockfish](https://github.com/zhelyabuzhsky/stockfish), and plays moves at a low skill level, but suggests moves to you with the maximum strength of the engine!
